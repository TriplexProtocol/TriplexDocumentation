- Implements an epoch-based vault system for clean accounting
- Provides flexible delegation of collateral to pools
- Manages debt distribution among participants

### Market Integration

Markets in Synthetix V3:
- Request credit capacity from pools based on configured weights
- Report debt changes back to the core protocol
- Implement market-specific logic for their unique use cases
- Share a common interface for protocol integration

### Risk Management

The risk management system:
- Implements multi-tiered liquidation mechanisms
- Enforces collateralization ratios at various levels
- Provides circuit breakers against extreme market conditions
- Enables governance oversight of risk parameters

## Technical Implementation Details
