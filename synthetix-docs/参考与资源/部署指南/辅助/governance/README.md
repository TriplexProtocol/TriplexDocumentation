# Governance in Synthetix V3

## Overview

The governance system in Synthetix V3 is designed to enable decentralized management of the protocol through a representative council model. It provides mechanisms for electing council members, voting on proposals, and executing governance decisions across the protocol's various components. The system balances the need for efficient decision-making with the principles of decentralization and stakeholder representation.

## Key Components

### 1. Election System

The [Election System](./election.md) manages the process of electing council members who will represent the protocol stakeholders:

- Conducts regular elections based on epochs
- Manages nomination and voting periods
- Counts votes using a sophisticated tally system
- Handles cross-chain voting when needed

### 2. Council Management

The [Council Management](./council.md) system handles the ongoing operations of the elected council:

- Tracks current council members and their status
- Manages council epoch transitions
- Enforces minimum active member requirements
- Coordinates council activities across periods

## Governance Workflow

The governance process in Synthetix V3 follows a structured timeline:

1. **Administration Period**: Council manages protocol operations
2. **Nomination Period**: Candidates are nominated for the next epoch
3. **Voting Period**: Token holders vote for their preferred candidates
4. **Evaluation Period**: Votes are tallied and new council members are determined
5. **Transition**: New council takes over for the next epoch

## Technical Implementation

The governance system is implemented through a set of specialized contracts:

- `ElectionModule`: Manages the election process and vote counting
- `ElectionModuleSatellite`: Handles cross-chain election operations
- `SnapshotVotePowerModule`: Determines voting power based on token holdings
- `ElectionInspectorModule`: Provides election monitoring capabilities

## Cross-Chain Governance

Synthetix V3 governance supports operations across multiple chains through:

1. **Wormhole Integration**: For cross-chain message passing
2. **Consistent Epoch Timing**: Synchronized governance periods across chains
3. **Consolidated Vote Counting**: Aggregating votes from multiple chains
4. **Cross-Chain Execution**: Implementing governance decisions across all chains

## User Participation

Token holders can participate in governance through:

1. **Voting**: Casting votes for council candidates during voting periods
2. **Nomination**: Nominating themselves or others as council candidates
3. **Delegation**: Delegating voting power to other community members
4. **Monitoring**: Tracking council activities and governance decisions

## System Security and Integrity

The governance system implements several security measures:

1. **Minimum Council Size**: Ensures sufficient representation
2. **Adjustable Periods**: Allows for optimization of governance timeline
3. **Transparent Vote Counting**: Verifiable election results
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Mechanisms for handling critical situations

## Ecosystem Integration

The governance system integrates with the broader Synthetix ecosystem:

1. **Core Protocol**: Council can adjust protocol parameters
2. **Markets**: Governance decisions affect market configurations
3. **Treasury**: Council manages protocol funds and incentives
4. **Development**: Governance guides protocol upgrades and development
