# Margin Types & Collateral

Margin types and collateral are key components of trading on the Synthetix Exchange. Understanding these concepts is essential for managing risk, optimizing capital efficiency, and improving trading performance.

## Cross-Margining: Maximizing Capital Efficiency

Cross-margining allows traders to leverage the total value of their account as collateral for multiple positions simultaneously. Instead of treating each trade individually, your entire portfolio acts as a unified source of collateral, which significantly enhances capital efficiency.

This approach reduces the likelihood of forced liquidations on individual trades and minimizes margin requirements, as profits from one position can offset losses in another. However, traders should be cautious: if the overall account balance falls below the required margin, the entire account is subject to liquidation.

In the future, isolated positions will be available to provide flexibility to traders.

## Margin Types

### Cross-Margin

- Pools liabilities from multiple positions in an account.
- Balances margins across positions, reducing the overall margin needed.
- Helps prevent liquidations on isolated trades by using profits from other positions as a buffer.
- Simplifies account management by consolidating all margins into a single balance.

Traders should note that liquidations now are no longer isolated to single positions but the account in its entirety!

### Isolated Margin

- Limits the liability of each trade to its own initial margin.
- Keeps risk confined to a specific position, preventing it from impacting the rest of the account.

_Currently unavailable on Synthetix Exchange v3, but planned for future updates. Isolated margin is only enabled for V2 Legacy Perps._

## What happened to sUSD?

In v2, sUSD was the decentralized stablecoin used for trading. In v3, this process has been streamlined. While v3 still uses a synthetic USD for accounting purposes, all deposits and withdrawals are processed through a wrapper. This means traders can now deposit and withdraw USDC on a 1:1 basis, enabling seamless integration with other collateral types and simplifying fund management.
