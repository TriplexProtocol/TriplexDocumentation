## TRT Staking

### Deposit TRT to The 420 Pool

<Callout type="info">
  Deposit to the 420 Pool to have your debt wiped clean and be free from liquidation risk.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Connect Your Wallet
  Go to 420.triplex.fi and connect with the wallet that holds your TRT staking position.

  ### Select Your Network
  Ensure you are on the correct network (Aptos Mainnet).

  ### Stake Your TRT
  Your staking position will automatically show up as available to deposit to the 420 Pool, including your associated debt balance â€” this is the amount that will be forgiven over 12 months.

  ### Burn Your Debt
  Once confirmed, your TRT will be delegated to the 420 Pool, and your debt will begin burning over 12 months. If you choose to exit before your debt is fully burned, you must repay your remaining debt, minus the early exit penalty.
</Steps>

### Debt Burn Calculation

When you deposit TRT into the 420 Pool, your debt will decrease linearly over 12 months. Each month reduces 8.33% of your initial debt.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you exit early, you must repay the remaining debt minus the relief applied and any penalties before withdrawing TRT.
</Callout>

#### Early Exit Examples

**Example 1:** Enter the 420 Pool with $1000 of debt and withdraw after 6 months

- Initial Debt: $1000
- Forgiven after 6 months: $500 (50%)
- Remaining Debt: $500
- Early Exit Penalty: $500 x 15\% = $75
- Amount to Pay on Exit: $500 + $75 = $575

**Example 2:** Enter the 420 Pool with $1000 of debt and withdraw after 9 months

- Initial Debt: $1000
- Forgiven after 9 months: $750 (75%)
- Remaining Debt: $250
- Early Exit Penalty: $250 x 15\% = $37.5
- Amount to Pay on Exit: $250 + $37.5 = $287.5

### Frequently Asked Questions

<Tabs items={['What is the 420 Pool?', 'How to earn rewards?', 'Early exit conditions', 'Debt burning mechanism']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The 420 Pool is a delegated staking contract where TRT holders can stake to earn their pro-rata share of yield. Protocol earned yield will be returned to the pool and used to compound returns, distribute to stakers or to buy back TRT.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Stakers will have a pro-rata claim on excess yield generated by the pool, be it excess stablecoins or TRT from buy backs - i.e. if you own 1% of the TRT staked in the 420 Pool, you'll have a claim on 1% of the yield generated.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Early exit requires repaying the remaining debt and paying a 15% penalty fee. You must settle these fees before withdrawing your TRT tokens.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    To eliminate the risks of solo-staking, TRT staker debt will be forgiven over a 12 month period from the time a user enters the 420 Pool. This happens linearly, with 8.33% of the initial debt reduced each month.
