## What is the 420 Pool?

The 420 Pool is designed to simplify staking. TRT holders are able to stake in this new pool to earn their pro-rata share of yield and/or assets. No debt management, no c-ratio, no liquidations - just stake and start earning.

## How does the 420 Pool earn yield?

The 420 Pool will be able to mint synthetic stablecoins at a 200% c-ratio based on the TRT deposited in the pool. With this stablecoin, the protocol will seek yield opportunities in places like Ethena, Aave, Maker, Berachain boyco vaults, etc.

## How will the yield be handled?

Protocol earned yield will be returned to the pool and used to compound returns, distribute to stakers or to buy back TRT.

## Who owns the yield?

TRT stakers! Stakers will have a pro-rata claim on excess yield generated by the pool, be it excess stablecoins or TRT from buy backs - i.e. if you own 1% of the TRT staked in the 420 Pool, you'll have a claim on 1% of the yield generated.

## When is yield distributed?

Yield will be distributed to stakers on a regular basis, proportional to their stake. The frequency of these distributions is yet to be determined.

## Are you locked in the pool?

There is a 7-day cooldown to exit the pool - i.e. users will be able to claim their TRT from the pool 7 days after they unstake.

## What is debt relief?

Historically, TRT holders have been able to mint synthetic stablecoins with their TRT assets. This has led to the existence of bad debt, underutilization of synthetic stablecoins, value leakage from the Triplex system, and death spiral problems. To overcome all these issues, the introduction of the 420 Pool will coincide with the final deprecation of solo staking. To eliminate the risks of solo-staking, TRT staker debt will be forgiven over a 12 month period from the time a user enters the 420 Pool.

Debt will be forgiven linearly (i.e. 50% forgiven after 6 months), but there will be early exit penalties which will result in a reduction of debt relief.

## Can I leave during the debt relief period?

You can exit the pool at any time during the debt relief period, but you must repay all debt minus the forgiven amount (including the early exit penalty) before you can withdraw any funds.

## What is the penalty for early exit?

Stakers leaving the 420 Pool before the end of the 12-month debt relief period will incur a penalty which will reduce the amount of debt they have had forgiven.

The penalty will be 100% from a staker's first day in the pool and linearly decrease to 50% on the last day of the 12-month lock.

## What if I have no debt?

You will have the opportunity to enter the 420 Pool and receive TRT rewards in the coming weeks! Please wait for now, as there will be a better opportunity for you to enter the pool soon.

## What happens if I have escrowed TRT?

Escrowed TRT will vest according to the same schedule as before your position was migrated to the 420 Pool. Escrowed TRT cannot be withdrawn until the vesting period has ended.

## When can I enter the pool?

Anytime! Early depositors will benefit from incentives that may be withdrawn in the future (such as debt relief), but you can join at any time.

## Will I be liquidated in the 420 Pool?

No - you can sleep easy knowing that your TRT will not be liquidated!
