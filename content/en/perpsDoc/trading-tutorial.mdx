<Steps>
### Connect a Compatible Wallet

First, navigate to [Triplex Exchange](https://exchange.triplex.io), click the "Connect Wallet" button in the upper right corner, and select your preferred wallet provider. Supported wallets include:

- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- Coinbase Wallet
- Other Ethereum-compatible wallets

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you are connected to a network supported by Triplex: Optimism, Base, or Arbitrum. If you have not yet bridged assets to these networks, please refer to our [Bridging Guide](./bridging).
</Callout>

### Create a Trading Account

After connecting your wallet, you need to create a V3 trading account:

1. Click the "Create Account" button on the main interface
2. Read and agree to the terms of service
3. Confirm the transaction to create the account (this requires a one-time gas fee)
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

Once the account is created, you will receive a unique account ID to identify all your activities and positions on Triplex.

<Callout type="warning">
Account creation is a one-time step and requires a gas fee. If you have previously created an account, you can directly import your existing account.
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Deposit Collateral

<Steps>
### Choose Collateral Type

Triplex supports multiple types of collateral, including:

- USDC
- ETH/wETH
- tpxBTC
- USDe
- stataUSDC

Choose the type of collateral you wish to deposit. Each type has its pros and cons, depending on your trading strategy and risk preference.

### Deposit Funds

1. Navigate to the "Account" section
2. Click the "Deposit" tab
3. Select the asset you want to deposit
4. Enter the deposit amount
5. Approve the contract to use your tokens (if depositing this asset for the first time)
6. Confirm the deposit transaction

<Callout type="info">
When depositing a specific type of token for the first time, you need to approve the smart contract to use these tokens. This is an additional gas transaction but only needs to be done once.
</Callout>

### Verify Deposit

Once the deposit transaction is confirmed, the funds should immediately appear in your account balance. You can view all your collateral balances in the "Account Overview" section.
</Steps>

## Swap and Bridge

If you need to convert one asset to another or transfer assets from one network to another, you can use the built-in swap and bridge features:

<Steps>
### Use the Swap Feature

1. Navigate to the "Trade" section and click the "Swap" tab
2. Select the source asset and target asset
3. Enter the amount to swap
4. Review the exchange rate and fees
5. Confirm the swap transaction

<Callout type="info">
The swap feature allows you to exchange one asset for another without leaving the platform, which is useful for adjusting your collateral portfolio.
</Callout>

### Use the Bridge Feature

1. Navigate to the "Bridge" section
2. Select the source network and target network
3. Choose the asset and amount to bridge
4. Confirm the bridge transaction
5. Wait for the funds to arrive on the target network (this may take a few minutes to a few hours)
</Steps>

## Enable One-Click Trading

The one-click trading feature allows you to execute trades quickly without paying gas fees:

<Steps>
### Enable One-Click Trading

1. Navigate to the trading interface
2. Find the "One-Click Trading" toggle switch and turn it on
3. Read and agree to the relevant terms
4. Sign the authorization transaction (one-time transaction)
5. Deposit a small amount of ETH as gas fees (this will be used to pay for your trade gas fees)

<Callout type="warning">
Enabling one-click trading requires granting Triplex permission to execute certain trades on your behalf. This authorization is carefully designed and limited to necessary trading functions.
</Callout>

### Verify One-Click Trading Setup

Once successfully enabled, the one-click trading status indicator will turn green, indicating that you can now trade without signing each transaction.
</Steps>

## Open a Position

Ready to start trading? Here are the steps to open a position:

<Steps>
### Choose a Market

Browse the list of markets supported by Triplex and select the asset you want to trade. You can see the current price, 24-hour change, and other key information for each asset.

### Configure Your Position

1. Choose a long (bullish) or short (bearish) position
2. Enter your position size (in USDC or token amount)
3. Set the leverage you wish to use (up to 25x, depending on the market)
4. Review your initial margin requirement, liquidation price, and potential profit/loss

<Callout type="info">
Higher leverage amplifies gains and losses while increasing liquidation risk. Beginners should start with lower leverage and gradually become familiar with leveraged trading.
</Callout>

### Confirm and Submit Order

1. Review the trade summary, including entry price, leverage, and slippage
2. Set advanced options if needed (such as limit or multi-step orders)
3. Click "Confirm" and sign the transaction (if one-click trading is not enabled) or submit directly (if one-click trading is enabled)
4. Wait for the trade to be confirmed

### Verify Your Open Position

Once the trade is complete, your new position will appear under the "Positions" tab. Here you can view details such as entry price, current market price, unrealized profit/loss (UPNL), and account health.
</Steps>

## Close a Position

When you're ready to end a trade, here are the steps to close a position:

<Steps>
### Navigate to Your Position

Find the position you want to close under the "Positions" tab and click the "Close" button.

### Configure Close Options

1. Choose the amount you want to close (all or partial)
2. Review the estimated exit price and realized profit/loss (PNL)
3. Configure any advanced options, such as limit price

### Confirm and Execute Close

Click "Confirm" and submit the close order. If one-click trading is enabled, this will execute immediately; otherwise, you need to sign the transaction.

<Callout type="info">
You can also use conditional orders (such as stop-loss, limit, or trailing stop) to automatically close positions when specific price levels are reached. For more information, refer to our [Conditional Orders](./conditional-orders) guide.
</Callout>

### Verify Close Result

After closing, your realized profit/loss will be applied to your account balance, and the position will disappear from the active positions list or reduce (if partially closed).
</Steps>

## Withdraw Collateral

When you're ready to withdraw funds back to your wallet from Triplex, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Navigate to the Withdrawal Section

Find the "Withdrawal" tab in the account dashboard.

### Configure Withdrawal

1. Select the type of asset you want to withdraw
2. Enter the withdrawal amount
3. Confirm the withdrawal address (usually your connected wallet)
4. Review the withdrawal summary, including any applicable fees

<Callout type="warning">
You can only withdraw the available balance not used to support open positions. If most of your funds are in use, you may need to close positions before withdrawing.
</Callout>

### Confirm and Execute Withdrawal

Click "Confirm" and sign the withdrawal transaction. This will require a gas fee.

### Verify Funds

Once the withdrawal is confirmed, the funds should appear in your wallet within a few minutes. You can check the transaction status on the blockchain explorer.
</Steps>

## Trading Tips and Best Practices

- **Start Small**：If you're new, it's recommended to start with small trades and low leverage.
- **Use Conditional Orders**：Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, especially when using high leverage.
- **Monitor Account Health**：Regularly check your account health to ensure it stays above safe levels, away from liquidation points.
- **Watch Funding Rates**：During high volatility, funding rates can change rapidly. Regularly check them because they affect the profitability of long-term position holding.
- **Diversify Your Collateral**：Consider using multiple collateral types to optimize your capital efficiency and risk exposure.

By completing this tutorial, you should now be able to create an account on Triplex Exchange, deposit funds, execute trades, and manage your positions.
