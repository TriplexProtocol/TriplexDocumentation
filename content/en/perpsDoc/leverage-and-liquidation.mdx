# Leverage and Liquidation

Understanding leverage trading and liquidation mechanisms is crucial for successful trading. These concepts determine your risk exposure, margin requirements, and account health management.

## Introduction to Leverage Trading

Leverage allows traders to control positions larger than their funds. For example, with 10x leverage, you can control a position worth 10,000 USDC with just 1,000 USDC. However, leverage is a double-edged sword: it can amplify gains but also magnify losses.

On Triplex Exchange, traders can access up to 25x leverage, allowing you to maximize market opportunities while implementing proper risk management practices.

## Initial and Maintenance Margin

Trading margin has two key components:

### Initial Margin

Initial margin is the minimum collateral amount required to open and maintain a leveraged position. It ensures you have enough funds to cover potential losses.

Calculation formula:
```
Initial Margin = Position Value / Maximum Available Leverage
```

For example, a position worth 10,000 USDC with a maximum leverage of 10x will require 1,000 USDC as initial margin.

Initial margin levels determine the maximum leverage you can use:
- 10x leverage = 10% initial margin requirement
- 25x leverage = 4% initial margin requirement

Higher initial margin (lower leverage) provides a greater safety buffer, while lower initial margin (higher leverage) increases liquidation risk.

### Maintenance Margin

Maintenance margin is the minimum collateral level that must be maintained to avoid liquidation. When account value falls below this level, the liquidation process begins. It is typically set as a small percentage of the initial margin requirement.

Calculation formula:
```
Maintenance Margin = Position Value * Maintenance Margin Rate
```

On Triplex Exchange, the maintenance margin rate is 2.5%, meaning a position worth 10,000 USDC requires at least 250 USDC as maintenance margin.

## Account Health and Liquidation

### Account Health (Margin Ratio)

Account health is a key indicator of how far your account is from liquidation. It is calculated as:

```
Account Health = (Account Equity / Maintenance Margin Requirement) * 100%
```

Where:
- **Account Equity** = Deposit Balance + Unrealized PnL (UPNL)
- **Maintenance Margin Requirement** = Total maintenance margin required for all open positions

### Account Health Status Indicator:

- **Good (Green)**: Account Health > 142.85%
- **Warning (Yellow)**: 142.85% > Account Health > 111.11%
- **Danger (Red)**: 111.11% > Account Health > 100%
- **Liquidation (Black)**: Account Health â‰¤ 100%

When account health drops to 100% or below, your positions will be liquidated to protect the system from bad debt!

## Liquidation Process

Liquidation is the automatic closing of positions when a trader's account value falls below the maintenance margin level. Here's how liquidation works:

1. **Trigger**: Liquidation is triggered when account health drops to 100% or below.
2. **Close Positions**: The system automatically closes all positions in the account.
3. **Fees**: A liquidation fee is charged, usually a small percentage of the position value.
4. **Settlement**: Remaining funds are returned to the trader's account.

### Actively Managing Risk

To avoid liquidation, you can adopt the following strategies:

- **Reduce Leverage**: Use lower leverage levels for a greater safety margin.
- **Add Collateral**: Add more collateral during market volatility to improve account health.
- **Stop-Loss Orders**: Set stop-loss orders to automatically close positions when prices reach certain levels.
- **Monitor Funding Rates**: High funding rates can erode your margin over time, especially for high-leverage positions.

## Using the Risk Calculator

Triplex Exchange provides a risk calculator to help you assess potential risks before opening a position:

- **Estimated Liquidation Price**: Clearly see at what price liquidation will be triggered.
- **Return Potential**: Estimate potential returns at different price levels.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risks associated with leveraged positions.

By understanding these leverage and liquidation mechanisms, you can better manage risk, protect your capital, and make informed decisions for your trading strategy.
