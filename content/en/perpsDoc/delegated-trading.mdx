# Delegated Trading

Delegated trading is a powerful feature that allows account holders to authorize other addresses to execute trading operations on their behalf. This is particularly useful for team account management, automated trading systems, and third-party integrations.

## What is Delegated Trading?

Delegated trading allows you to specify trusted addresses (delegates) and authorize them to perform specific operations on behalf of your account without sharing your private key. This creates a layer of secure access control, enabling you to manage your trading flexibly while maintaining ultimate control over your account.

Delegated trading is different from standard wallet authorization. It is a special relationship within the Triplex platform that allows for more granular permission control and restrictions.

## Use Cases for Delegated Trading

Delegated trading is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- **Team Account Management**: Multiple team members can trade on one account without sharing the main wallet's private key.
- **Automated Trading Systems**: Allow trading bots or algorithms to execute trades on your behalf without continuous manual approval.
- **Fund Management**: Authorize professional traders or fund managers to trade on your behalf.
- **Cold Wallet Security**: Keep your main wallet in cold storage while using a hot wallet as a delegate for daily trading.

## How to Start Using Delegation

### Adding a Delegate

To add a new delegate:

1. Navigate to the "Delegation Management" section in your Triplex Exchange account settings.
2. Click "Add Delegate" and enter the wallet address you wish to authorize.
3. Set the delegate's permissions and restrictions (if applicable).
4. Confirm and sign the authorization transaction.

Carefully verify the delegate address you add. Once authorized, the delegate will be able to access your account within the specified limits.

### Delegate Permission Levels

The Triplex delegation system offers several permission levels that you can assign as needed:

- **Full Trading Permission**: Allows the delegate to open, modify, and close positions.
- **Read-Only Permission**: Allows the delegate to view account information but not execute trades.
- **Modify-Only Permission**: Allows the delegate to modify existing positions but not open new ones.
- **Close-Only Permission**: Allows the delegate to close positions to prevent liquidation.

### Setting Trading Limits

To enhance security, you can set specific limits for delegates:

- **Maximum Position Size**: Limit the size of positions the delegate can open.
- **Market Restrictions**: Restrict the specific markets the delegate can trade.
- **Maximum Leverage**: Set the maximum leverage level the delegate can use.
- **Time Restrictions**: Set an expiration time for the delegation authorization.

## Managing Delegates

### Viewing Delegate Activity

You can monitor delegate activity in your account dashboard:

1. Navigate to the "Delegate Activity" tab.
2. View the complete history of all delegated trades, including timestamps, trade types, and associated delegates.
3. Filter activities to find specific delegates or trade types.

### Modifying or Revoking Delegation

If you need to change delegation settings or revoke delegation entirely:

1. Go to the "Delegation Management" section.
2. Select the delegate you wish to modify.
3. Update permission settings or click "Revoke Delegation" to remove their access entirely.
4. Confirm your changes.

<Callout type="error">
Revoking delegation is immediate. Once confirmed, the delegate will no longer be able to execute any trading operations. Ensure you have a proper management plan in place before revoking access to critical delegates if your account has active positions.
</Callout>

## Accessing Accounts as a Delegate

If you are authorized to access someone else's account as a delegate:

1. Connect your wallet to Triplex Exchange.
2. Find the "Delegated Accounts" section under the wallet selector.
3. View the list of accounts you have access to.
4. Select an account to start trading on behalf of that account.

When trading and performing operations, the interface will clearly indicate that you are acting as a delegate and display any restrictions related to your permission level.

## Best Practices for Delegated Trading Security

To ensure the security of delegated trading, consider the following recommendations:

- **Verify Delegates**: Only add addresses you fully trust as delegates.
- **Use Specific Limits**: Apply specific trading limits rather than granting unrestricted access.
- **Regularly Review**: Regularly review delegate activities and permissions.
- **Test with Small Limits**: Start with small trading limits when first setting up a delegate, then gradually increase as needed.
- **Revoke Unused Delegations**: Timely revoke permissions if a delegation relationship is no longer needed.

By understanding and applying these delegated trading features, you can create a more secure and flexible trading workflow while maintaining ultimate control over your account.
