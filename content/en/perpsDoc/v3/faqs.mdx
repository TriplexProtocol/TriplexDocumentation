## Margin and Collateral

### What is cross-margin?

Cross-margin is an account structure where all collateral is used to provide margin for all positions. This brings the following features:

- **Higher capital efficiency**: Collateral can be used to support multiple positions simultaneously
- **Automatic risk hedging**: Positions in different directions can offset each other's risk
- **Centralized management**: No need to manage multiple separate margin accounts

Compared to isolated margin, cross-margin can more efficiently utilize funds, but it also means that all positions share risk.

### What collateral does Triplex support?

Triplex V3 supports various types of collateral:

- **USDC**: Main stablecoin collateral
- **USDe**: Ethena stablecoin
- **ETH/wETH**: Ethereum and wrapped Ethereum
- **tpxBTC**: Bitcoin tokens supported by Threshold Network
- **stataUSDC**: Aave-staked USDC

Different collateral may have different margin coefficients and risk parameters.

### How to add or withdraw collateral?

Steps to add or withdraw collateral in Triplex:

1. Click on "Wallet" or "Collateral" in the platform navigation menu
2. Choose "Deposit" or "Withdraw" operation
3. Select collateral type and amount
4. Confirm transaction and wait for block confirmation

<Callout type="warning">
Before withdrawing collateral, please ensure your account has enough remaining margin to maintain existing positions. The system will prevent withdrawals that may trigger liquidation.
</Callout>

### What is the difference between different collateral types?

The main differences between collateral types in the Triplex system:

| Collateral | Volatility | Margin Efficiency | Features |
|-------|-------|-----------|------|
| USDC | Extremely low | Highest | Baseline stablecoin, highest margin efficiency |
| USDe | Extremely low | High | Similar to USDC but with a slightly different mechanism |
| ETH/wETH | Medium-high | Medium | Provides price protection against price increases but has volatility risk |
| tpxBTC | High | Medium-low | Bitcoin exposure, higher volatility |
| stataUSDC | Low | High | Provides additional yield but has some liquidity restrictions |

## Trading and Risk Management

### What is account health?

Account health is a key indicator of collateral status in an account, calculated as:

```
Account Health = (Account Equity / Maintenance Margin Requirement) × 100%
```

- **Health > 100%**：Account is safe, will not be liquidated
- **Health = 100%**：Account is at the critical state, any adverse price movement may trigger liquidation
- **Health < 100%**：Account will be liquidated

<Callout type="error">
It is recommended to maintain account health above 150% especially when using volatile collateral or when market volatility is high.
</Callout>

### How to avoid liquidation?

Best practices to avoid liquidation:

1. **Monitor account health**：Regularly check, especially during market volatility
2. **Set alerts**：Use Triplex's notification feature to set health alert
3. **Moderate leverage**：Choose appropriate leverage based on your risk tolerance
4. **Add collateral**：Increase collateral when health drops
5. **Partial liquidation**：Reduce position size to lower margin requirement
6. **Hedge positions**：Open small position in opposite direction to hedge risk

### Can I continue trading after liquidation?

Yes, after liquidation, you can continue trading as long as there is collateral in your account:

- **Partial liquidation**：Only liquidate enough positions to restore health, remaining positions and collateral still available
- **Full liquidation**：All positions are closed, but remaining collateral still available in account for new transactions
- **Add collateral**：Can add new collateral at any time to start trading again

### What is funding rate, and how does it affect my trading?

Funding rate is a unique mechanism of perpetual contracts used to keep the contract price consistent with the spot price:

- **Calculation cycle**：Usually settled every 8 hours
- **Rate direction**：When contract premium, longs pay shorts; when contract discount, shorts pay longs
- **Trading strategy impact**：High funding rate may significantly affect long-term position profitability

<Tabs items={['Long Strategy', 'Short Strategy', 'Arbitrage Strategy']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   For long traders:

  - **Positive funding rate**：Need to pay fees, reduce position yield
  - **Negative funding rate**：Receive fees, increase position yield
  
  In a high positive funding rate environment, longs can consider:
  
  1. Shift to short-term trading instead of long-term holding
  2. Wait for funding rate to return to reasonable range before opening position
  3. Use limit order to get better opening price, offset part of fee cost
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
   For short traders:

  - **Positive funding rate**：Receive fees, increase position yield
  - **Negative funding rate**：Need to pay fees, reduce position yield
  
  In a high negative funding rate environment, shorts can consider:
  
  1. Shift to short-term trading strategy
  2. Wait for funding rate to return to reasonable range
  3. Calculate whether fee cost exceeds expected price decline yield
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
   Funding rate arbitrage strategy:

   When funding rate is extreme (high positive or high negative), the following arbitrage strategy can be considered:
  
  1. **Spot-Perpetual Arbitrage**:
     - High positive rate: Short perpetual + Buy spot
     - High negative rate: Long perpetual + Short spot
  
  2. **Exchange Arbitrage**:
     - Utilize funding rate differences between different exchanges
     - Long in low-rate platform, short in high-rate platform
  
  Please note that arbitrage strategy needs to consider transaction fees, spread, and execution risk.
