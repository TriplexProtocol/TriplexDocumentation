# Triplex V3 Overview

## What are the new features of Perps V3?

Triplex V3 has undergone several significant upgrades from previous versions, providing traders with a more powerful and flexible trading experience:

- **Native Cross Margin**: This feature allows traders to use their entire investment portfolio as collateral, enhancing trading efficiency and risk management.

- **Better Pricing**: In Perps V3, the price at the time of order submission—the price at the moment you submit your order—is the price at which your trade is executed. This upgrade eliminates the frustration of price slippage due to execution delays.

- **Failed Order Replacement**: Orders that fail to execute no longer need to be "canceled." Once failed, traders can simply place another order, which will automatically replace the failed trade.

- **Redesigned User Experience**: Perps V3 introduces significant improvements to navigation, trading processes, and data presentation. This comprehensive overhaul focuses on intuitiveness and efficiency, ensuring both novice and experienced traders can fully leverage the platform's capabilities.

## What's under the hood?

### NFT Accounts

NFT accounts are an innovative approach to account management in V3, providing a more flexible and user-friendly way to manage trading activities. As a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), your trading account can:

- Be transferred between different wallets
- Be authorized to other addresses for management
- Be visualized alongside your other Web3 assets

<Callout type="warning">
Having your account as an NFT means you can transfer it, but it also means you need to take care of it. If you lose access to the wallet holding the account NFT, you will no longer be able to access the account.

The design of Super Markets allows for:
- Efficient cross-margin calculations
- Isolated risk environments
- Flexible market grouping
