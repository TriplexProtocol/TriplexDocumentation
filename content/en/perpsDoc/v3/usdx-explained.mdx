# What is USDx?

USDx is a key innovation in Triplex V3, serving as a synthetic dollar unit used internally by the platform to handle multiple types of collateral and simplify margin accounting. This article will explain the concept of USDx, its operational mechanism, and its importance within the Triplex ecosystem.

## Basic Concept of USDx

USDx is essentially an internal accounting unit rather than a tradable token. It represents the dollar value of various collaterals deposited into a Triplex account. This unified value representation is a core component of the multi-collateral system, enabling the platform to consistently handle different types of assets.

It is important to understand that USDx is not a token that can be withdrawn or transferred; it is purely for internal accounting purposes.

### Difference Between USDx and sUSD

In earlier versions of the platform, sUSD was used as the primary settlement currency. USDx is an improved mechanism in V3, designed specifically to handle multiple types of collateral:

- **sUSD**: A specific synthetic token that users can directly hold or trade.
- **USDx**: An internal accounting unit that exists only within the Triplex system and cannot be transferred or traded.

## Role of USDx

USDx performs several key functions within the Triplex ecosystem:

1. **Value Unification**: Converts the value of different collaterals (such as ETH, USDC, tpxBTC, etc.) into a unified unit.
2. **Margin Calculation**: Provides a common measurement unit for calculating account health and liquidation thresholds.
3. **Position Handling**: Allows the system to use multiple types of collateral for opening and maintaining margin.
4. **Risk Management**: Enables the system to measure the total risk exposure of different collaterals.

## Benefits of USDx

The USDx mechanism offers several advantages to Triplex users:

- **Capital Efficiency**: Allows users to utilize multiple types of collateral without needing to convert all assets into a single type of stablecoin.
- **Maintain Market Exposure**: Users can maintain market exposure to their collateral assets (such as ETH, BTC, etc.) while still using the dollar value of these assets for trading.
- **Simplified User Experience**: Seamless handling of multiple collaterals in the background provides users with a simple and unified interface.
- **Reduced Slippage Costs**: Eliminates the need for large asset conversions before starting trading, reducing associated slippage and transaction fees.

While USDx offers many advantages, users should be aware that changes in the value of volatile collateral directly affect their account health. Market fluctuations may lead to margin calls or liquidation risks.

## Comparison of USDx with Other Systems

USDx has some similarities with other accounting units in the DeFi ecosystem but also important differences:

- **Comparison with Maker's DAI**: Unlike DAI, USDx is not a tradable token but merely an internal accounting unit.
- **Comparison with Aave's aToken**: Similar to aToken, USDx represents the value of user assets, but USDx does not appreciate over time.
- **Comparison with Compound's cToken**: Unlike cToken, USDx does not represent a claim on a liquidity pool.

In summary, USDx is a unique mechanism designed specifically for Triplex's multi-collateral margin system, aimed at enhancing capital efficiency and risk management.
